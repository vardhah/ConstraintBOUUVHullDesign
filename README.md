# Contrained Bayesian optimization for Underwater vehicle hull design


In this work, the research motivation is to integrate and deploy the AI based constraint Bayesian optimization to the computationally complex and hard design problem that involves complex engineering domains like CAD and CFD in loop. The constrained is generated by packing the components in the UUV. To, this end we used the following pipeline:

## How to use the code: 
For running you need to install two docker container 
1. Docker to run CFD: can be downloded from [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/kishorestevens/dexof/tags)
2. Docker to run CAD design and assembly from [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/vardhah/freecad) 

Once both dockers are installed, we need to install optimization algotrithms - we use GpOPt for this work.
