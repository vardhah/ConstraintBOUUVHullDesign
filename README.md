# Contrained Bayesian optimization for Underwater vehicle hull design


In this work, the research motivation is to integrate and deploy the AI based constraint Bayesian optimization to the computationally complex and hard design problem that involves complex engineering domains like CAD and CFD in loop. The constrained is generated by packing the components in the UUV. To, this end we used the following pipeline:

### Results:
optimal design by only changing nose shape and tail shape:

OPtimal design after providing flexibility of extending the nose and tail length along with their shapes:

## How to reuse the code and experiment:
Apart from python-3 (we used python 3.7) you also need to install Docker engine on your machine. We used linux based OS (Ubuntu 18.04) for our experiment, but any OS with python 3.7 should be fine (Let us know if it does not work for you).

For running the code, you need to download two docker container pre-installed with dependencies along with CAD and CFD software.  
1. Docker to run CFD: can be downloaded from [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/kishorestevens/dexof/tags)
2. Docker to run CAD design and assembly from [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/vardhah/freecad/tags)

Once both dockers are ready, we also need to install optimization algorithms - we use [GpOPt](https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPyOpt) for this work. Once everything is installed, experiment can be run by cloning the repository and running :
1. main_bo.py : To run bayesian optimization with LCB as acquisition function.
