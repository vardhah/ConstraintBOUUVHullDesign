# Contrained Bayesian optimization for Underwater vehicle hull design


In this work, the research motivation is to integrate and deploy the AI based constraint Bayesian optimization to the computationally complex and hard design problem that involves complex engineering domains like CAD and CFD in loop. The constrained is generated by packing the components in the UUV. To, this end we used the following pipeline:

## How to use the code:
For running you need to install two docker container
1. Docker to run CFD: can be downloaded from [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/kishorestevens/dexof/tags)
2. Docker to run CAD design and assembly from [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/vardhah/freecad)

Once both dockers are installed, we need to install optimization algorithms - we use GpOPt and pymoo for this work. Once everything is installed, experiment can be run by cloning the repository and running :
1. main_bo.py : to run bayesian optimization with LCB as acquisition function.
2. main_ga.py : to run pymoo with GA as optimization method.

### Comparison of results:
GA (baseline) vs BO on a given budget using our framework:
